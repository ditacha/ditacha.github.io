## Overview
**Configuration** is as a special type of design approach where the product being configured is composed from instances of a set of predefined component types that can be combined in ways defined by a set of constraints. This task requires powerful knowledge representation formalisms and acquisition methods to capture the variety and complexity of configurable products. Furthermore, efficient reasoning methods are required to support intelligent interactive behavior, solution search, satisfaction of user preferences, personalization, optimization, reconfiguration, and diagnosis.

The main goal of the workshop is to promote high-quality research in all technical areas related to configuration. The workshop is of interest for both researchers working in the various fields of applicable technologies and industry representatives interested in the relationship between configuration technology and the business problem behind configuration and mass customization.

## Topics
Workshop topics include but are not limited to the following ones:

- **Configuration Problems and Models.**
Definitions of configuration, reconfiguration, distributed configuration. Definitions of product, process, system, service configuration. Structure of configuration problems. Knowledge representation, ontologies, fuzzy and incomplete knowledge, standardization of catalog exchange formats, feature models. Representations for product and process configuration, product design and configuration.

## Paper Submission
- **Full papers** are limited to 10 pages (including references). 
- **Position statements** and **problem instances** can be submitted as **short papers** limited to 4 pages (including references). 

**Website Submission:** Papers should be submitted to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=confws23).

**Formatting guildelines:** Both full and short papers must be formatted in PDF according to the new [CEUR-ART style](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/) using the two-columns template.
- [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/hpvjjzhjxzjk)
- [Latex template](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip)
- [DOCX template](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEUR-Template-2col.docx)
- [ODT template](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEUR-Template-2col.odt)

Latex users should modify the following code placed at the start of the Latex document as follows:

```
\copyrightyear{2023}
\conference{ConfWS'23: 25th International Workshop on Configuration, Sep 7--8, 2023, Málaga, Spain}
```

Word users should modify the same information at the bottom of the first page.

**Publication:**
Each submission will be subject to peer review by at least two members of the program committee. Refereeing criteria are relevance to workshop topics, significance and novelty of the research, technical content, discussion of relationship to previous work, and clarity of presentation. A contribution submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper, if the program committee considers it to be inadequate for a long full paper but to present an important issue. 
It is possible to submit already published or submitted articles. In that case, submit both a one-page abstract (600 words) and the article, and take note that the article will not be included in the proceedings. A limited number (max 4) of already published articles will be accepted.
{: .text-justify}

The proceedings will be published in the [CEUR Workshop Proceedings library](CEUR-WS.org). 

At least one author of each accepted paper must register and present the paper in ConfWS'23 in order for the submission to be published.

## Best Paper Award
ConfWS'23 again plans *Best Paper Awards*. 
Two papers will be recognized: 
- The best paper.
- The best PhD student paper.
