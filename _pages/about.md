**1st Digital Transformation Advances and Challenges Workshop (DITACHA 2023)**

---
- May 25 – 26, 2023
- Venue: E.T.S. Ingeniería Informática, Universidad de Sevilla, Spain

Beside researchers from a variety of configuration-related fields, the workshop has always attracted a significant number of participants from industry (major configurator vendors as well as application developers).

The main goal of the workshop is to promote high-quality research in all technical areas related to configuration and to bring together researchers and practitioners from industry and academia. The workshop is of interest for both researchers working in the various fields of applicable technologies and industry representatives interested in the relationship between configuration technology and the business problem behind configuration and mass customization.
